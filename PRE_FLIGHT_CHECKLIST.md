## 🕐 30 MINUTES BEFORE

### Database Setup
- [ ] **Clean database (for fresh demo):**
  ```bash
  mongosh secure-fin-data --eval "db.users.deleteMany({})"
  ```
  *(Or skip if you want to keep existing test users)*

- [ ] **Verify MongoDB connection:**
  ```bash
  mongosh secure-fin-data --eval "db.stats()"
  ```

### Application Test Run
- [ ] **Start the application:**
  ```bash
  cd /Users/nabinchapagain/secure-fin-data
  npm run dev
  ```

- [ ] **Wait for both servers:**
  - ✅ Backend: `Secure Financial Data API Server running on port 3001`
  - ✅ Frontend: `VITE v5.4.20 ready`
  - ✅ MongoDB: `MongoDB connected successfully`

- [ ] **Open browser to http://localhost:3000**

- [ ] **Quick registration test:**
  - Register test user
  - Verify email shows in browser console (no errors)
  - Click "Login" link works

- [ ] **Quick login test:**
  - Login with test user
  - Verify dashboard loads
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Quick upload test:**
  - Upload one small PDF
  - Verify "✅ File encrypted successfully!" message
  - Check terminal shows success logs
  - **Note the processing time** (should be 10-20ms)

- [ ] **Stop servers (Ctrl+C)** - you'll restart fresh before demo

---

## 🕐 10 MINUTES BEFORE

### Final Setup
- [ ] **Close test browser tab** (start fresh)

- [ ] **Restart MongoDB:**
  ```bash
  brew services restart mongodb-community
  sleep 5  # Wait for it to fully start
  ```

- [ ] **Start application fresh:**
  ```bash
  cd /Users/nabinchapagain/secure-fin-data
  npm run dev
  ```

- [ ] **Verify both servers running** (check terminal output)

- [ ] **Arrange windows:**
  - **Screen 1 (Main):** Browser (http://localhost:3000)
  - **Screen 2 (Optional):** Terminal with logs visible
  - **Screen 3 (Optional):** VS Code with key files open

- [ ] **Open browser to localhost:3000** but don't login yet

- [ ] **Test PDFs ready on Desktop** and visible

### Mental Preparation
- [ ] **Review talking points** from DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.md
- [ ] **Practice opening line** once
- [ ] **Deep breath** - you got this! 😊

---

## 🕐 2 MINUTES BEFORE

### Final Checks
- [ ] **Application running** (check terminal - no errors)
- [ ] **Browser at http://localhost:3000** (blank login page)
- [ ] **Test PDFs visible** on desktop or file manager
- [ ] **Water nearby** (for your throat!)
- [ ] **Phone on silent** 📵
- [ ] **Confident smile** 😊

### Quick Reminders
- **Speak slowly** - don't rush
- **Explain while you type** - keep talking
- **Highlight the time** - "10ms encryption!"
- **Show terminal logs** at least once
- **If something fails** - stay calm, restart, or show GitHub

---

## ✅ GO TIME!

You're ready! Remember:

🎯 **Opening:** "I built a secure financial data platform that encrypts files in under 10 milliseconds using military-grade AES-256-GCM encryption."

🎬 **Demo Flow:**
1. Register (30s)
2. Login (20s)
3. Upload file (60s)
4. Show terminal (30s)
5. Upload second file (30s)

💬 **Closing:** "This is production-ready, follows industry standards, and the code is on GitHub. Questions?"

## 🚨 EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### If MongoDB won't start:
```bash
brew services stop mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
# Wait 10 seconds
npm run dev
```

### If ports are busy:
```bash
killall node
npm run dev
```

### If nothing works:
1. Stay calm
2. Show GitHub repository
3. Show logs from previous successful run
4. Explain what it does
5. Offer to demo later

### Have backup plan:
- [ ] **Screenshots** of successful encryption
- [ ] **Pre-recorded video** of demo (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] **Logs file** with success messages
- [ ] **GitHub README** with architecture diagrams
