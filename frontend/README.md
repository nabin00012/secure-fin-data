# Frontend - Secure Financial Data Platform

## Current Status

The frontend is currently in **minimal setup** state with basic React structure. The backend API is fully functional and can be tested using the interactive demo.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0

### Installation
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Current Features

- ✅ Basic React setup with TypeScript
- ✅ Vite build system 
- ✅ Simple landing page with backend info
- ✅ Proxy configuration for API calls

## What's Working

The frontend currently shows a simple landing page that:
- Displays project information
- Shows available backend features  
- Provides instructions for trying the demo
- Links to the backend server

## Backend Integration

While the frontend UI is minimal, the backend is fully functional:

- **API Endpoints**: All REST endpoints are working
- **Interactive Demo**: Run `cd ../backend && npm run demo`
- **Health Checks**: Backend monitoring is active
- **Security Features**: Full encryption and auth system

## Next Steps

To complete the frontend (estimated 4-6 hours):

1. **Authentication UI**
   - Login/Register forms
   - JWT token management
   - Protected routes

2. **File Management**  
   - File upload interface
   - Encryption status display
   - Results visualization

3. **Dashboard**
   - User dashboard
   - File list and search
   - Analytics charts

4. **Admin Interface**
   - User management
   - System monitoring
   - Audit logs

## Development Notes

The current setup uses:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development builds  
- **Minimal dependencies** to avoid errors
- **Proxy config** for backend API calls

## Testing the Platform

For now, use the backend demo to see all features:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm run demo
```

This showcases:
- User registration and authentication
- File encryption and processing  
- Financial data analytics
- Admin dashboard features
- Security audit logging

**Note**: The backend is production-ready with enterprise security features. The frontend placeholder allows the full-stack project to be demonstrated via the interactive CLI demo.
